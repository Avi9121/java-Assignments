Example :
            // Class 1
           // Helper class to illustrate native keyword 
        
          class Native{
             static{
             System.loadLibrary("Native library path");
            }
        
               // Native method 
    
             public native void m();
           }

                // Main class 
         class GFG{
    
           public static void main(String[] args) {
        
             // creating object of helper class inside main() 
             Native n = new Native();

                // Calling native method that is defined
                // inside  the above class
             n.m();
           }
         }
