2. Realize the usage of 'final' keyword with examples

===========================================================================================


Final Keyword in Java :

Final keyword is used in different contexts. First of all, final is a non-access modifier applicable 
only to a variable, a method or a class. Following are different contexts where final is used.

Final Variables  ----> To Create Constant Variables.

Final Methods    ----> Prevent Method Overriding.

Final Classes    ----> Prevent Inheritance. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -->Final Variables : 

When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant.
 This also means that you must initialize a final variable. If the final variable is a reference, this 
means that the variable cannot be re-bound to reference another object, but the internal state of the 
object pointed by that reference variable can be changed i.e. you can add or remove elements from the
final array or final collection. It is good practice to represent final variables in all uppercase, 
using underscore to separate words.

Examples : // a final variable
              final int THRESHOLD = 5;

           // a blank final variable
              final int THRESHOLD;

          // a final static variable PI
             static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;

          // a  blank final static  variable
             static final double PI;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->Final classes :

When a class is declared with final keyword, it is called a final class. A final class cannot be 
extended(inherited)

1. One is definitely to prevent inheritance, as final classes cannot be extended. For example, 
all Wrapper Classes like Integer, Float, etc. are final classes. We can not extend them.


        final class A{
              // methods and fields
        }
              // The following class is illegal
        class B extends A { 
              // COMPILE-ERROR! Can't subclass A
         }


2. The other use of final with classes is to create an immutable class like the predefined 
String class. One can not make a class immutable without making it final.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--->Final Methods : 

When a method is declared with final keyword, it is called a final method. A final method cannot be
overridden. The Object class does this—a number of its methods are final. We must declare methods 
with the final keyword for which we are required to follow the same implementation throughout all 
the derived classes. 


                 class A {
                     final void m1() {
                          System.out.println("This is a final method.");
                     }
                 }

                 class B extends A{
                     void m1(){ 
                        // Compile-error! We can not override
                        System.out.println("Illegal!");
                      }
                 }
