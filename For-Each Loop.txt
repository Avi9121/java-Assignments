-->FOR_EACH LOOP:

        The for each loop is another variant of the for loop that iterates over a list or 
array of elements. The same function is done on each item.


->Syntax:
         
    The syntax starts out with the standard for keyword followed by parentheses or simple brackets.
 The brackets contain an object name of some data type followed by a colon followed by an array 
of the same data type as the declared object.

                       for (datatype item : array){
                                statements using item
                       }


-->EXAMPLE :

     
             class ForEach {
                     public static void main( String args[] ) {
                      int nums[] = {23, 48, 66, 20, 24, 9, 10};
                      int max = 0;
                          for (int number: nums){
                              System.out.print(number + " ");
                              if(max < number)
                              max = number;
                          }

                          System.out.println("The maximum element in the array is " + max);
                    }
                }
